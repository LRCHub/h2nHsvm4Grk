"Steal my soul", he laughed
As he ran away
Chasing him with blindfold eyes,
Leave me to linger
On his every word;
Follow him through sky blue rooms.
The corners blur, the ceilings fall
On our heads. we roll in bed.
Tumbling through fluffy sheets.
Reeling in love; confused by my heart.

Lah Lah Lah Lah Lah Lah Lah...

You made me smile,
I'm so in love.
I made you cry,
I never want to lose you.
